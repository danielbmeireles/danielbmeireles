## 👋🏼 Hello, and Welcome!!!

My name is Daniel Meireles 🇧🇷 🇵🇹

I’m a Cloud Solution Architect at [Zoi](https://www.zoi.tech/), a German-based consulting company with offices worldwide, including in Lisbon, Portugal (where I live). I'm a "_Microsoft Azure Security Engineer Associate_" and "_CompTIA Cloud+ Certified._" I also have several other certifications in my portfolio, like the "_LPIC-2 Linux Engineer_" and "_IBM Power Systems Certified Advanced Technical Expert_" titles.

I’m also interested in Comic Books and everything related to Productivity and Personal Organization.

Feel free to contact me!

I like my infrastructure the same way I like my coffee: defined as code ☕️
