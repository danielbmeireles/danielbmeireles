Hello there ;)

I’m a Cloud Solution Architect at [Zoi](https://www.zoi.tech/) living in Lisbon, Portugal. I'm a "Microsoft Azure Security Engineer Associate" and "CompTIA Cloud+ Certified." I also have several other certifications in my portfolio, like the LPIC-2 Linux Engineer and an "IBM Power Systems Certified Advanced Technical Expert" title.

I’m also interested in Comic Books and everything related to Productivity and Personal Organization.

Feel free to contact me!
